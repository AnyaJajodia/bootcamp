# Just Add Water, No Code Required

## I don't want to be a geek/nerd/hacker at 40, I have a life now

Computer Programming technology does a complete refresh almost every 3-5 years. This is true for both the commercial potential as well as most of the underlying technology that binds an application or service together. After going through the wringer a few times, one realises that the retraining process is no longer as exciting as it once was. Relearning new coding recepies, syntax and reinventing-the-wheel to be more efficient and multifunctional tool gets old after a few iterations. 

So now what, well you've got a few years of experience under your belt so time to jump into the big-bucks field. But what are they?

1. Data Scientist
2. DevOps Engineer
3. Software Architect

All of the above have an average salary of $120k - $150k (2021 figures) and are at the top of the job pyramid.

## What does the future hold?

IT related jobs today are in continental US or US-based firms. 

However, the US Govt has increasingly passed outsourcing restrictions and compulsory hire-local employment policies since 2012*. They have also started an intensive education program to encourage STEM graduates as well as subsidised and/or funded Coding workshops for their schools. It is thus expected that the current high-demand for Indian IT Software professionals will dimish rapidly in the next 5 years.

There are AI and ML technologies in the works that will be able to write a majority of the programming code and debug it. The need for entry-level programmers is thus diminishing and will progressive reduce their demand.

(Entry level) programmers with 2 - 5 years experience are now available from other asian and east European countries as their education systems and training facilities have vastly improved. As local salaries increase it will be unviable for outsourcing to continue as the current level.

During the 2000 decade the Indian programmers have a vast knowledge bank with years of experience as technology turnaround was still at a 7 - 10 year cycle. Now its only 3 years, thus more freshers can be utilised on a project thereby reducing the need for more experienced programmers.

In conclusion, basic programming skills are going to be redundant in the next few years. However, the advanced fields mentioned above are becoming mainstream and their demand will increase globally.

Traditional programming jobs will become less attractive. New technology implementation of cloud services, data mining and analysis, process automation will be in demand and will pay the big bucks.

Or you can always create the next unicorn startup!

## Next-Generation Skill Set

Essentially build the ability to use online/cloud tools available to solve a business problem. This will involve knowing the underlying programming languages, standards and protocols, the business domain and Statistics (for Data Analysis).

- Business Process Automation using AI + ML
- Data Analytics with Big Data tools
- Surveillance and Anomaly Detection with Image Processing and Analysis
- Financial Technology
- Blockchain and Crypto Currency (Centralised)
- Cyber Security and Policing

## Just Add Water, No code required

You are the water that will bind all the tools into a solution. Thus, add you to build and monitor the solution. Use off-the-shelf tools and services. The current model of developing an application or service from scratch is going to be too expensive and will take too long for production quality.

Most of these tools will not require you to write any code or a minimal level of code at best.

... to be continued.
